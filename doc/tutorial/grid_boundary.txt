==================================
Setting values for grid boundaries
==================================

.. note::

    At the time of writing of this tutorial (september 2012), only the
    Athena and Capreole hydrodynamics codes support the user
    defined boundaries.
    
In AMUSE, you can specify how a hydrodynamics grid code handles the 
boundary conditions. Hydrodynamic grid codes define a number of 
special grid cells at all ends of the grid. These cells are often 
called boundary or ghost cells and are handled differently by the 
code. The flow-variables in these cells are not evolved but 
calculated from other cells or from a user defined function.

Supported boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each code in amuse will need to provide at least 3 kinds of boundary 
conditions:

periodic
    To simulate periodically repeating problems. Periodic boundary 
    conditions simulates as if the grid is connected to a copy of 
    itself, often implemented by copying over the data at the 
    opposite site of the grid to the boundary cells.
reflect
    Mirrors all grid variables in the boundary cells, often 
    implemented by copying the data of the cells connected to the 
    boundary into the boundary cells.
outflow
    Sets the derivative of the flow variables with respect to the 
    direction of the boundary to zero.

The following picture shows all three boundary conditions for a one
dimensional grid with 4 boundary cells:

Boundary conditions are defined by setting the a boundary parameter for
each boundary of the grid of a code. These boundaries are defined:

xbound1
    The x-axis boundary on the left side of the grid, often called
    the inflow boundary
xbound2
    The x-axis boundary on the right side of the grid, often called
    the outflow boundary
ybound1
    The y-axis boundary on the bottom side of the grid, often called
    the inflow boundary
ybound2
    The y-axis boundary on the top side of the grid, often called
    the outflow boundary
zbound1
    The z-axis boundary on the front side of the grid, often called
    the inflow boundary
zbound2
    The z-axis boundary on the back side of the grid, often called
    the outflow boundary
    
.. image:: boundaries2.png

.. code-block:: python
    code = Athena()
    code.parameters.xbound1 = "periodic"
    code.parameters.ybound1 = "reflect"

You can also set the boundary per axis as an ```(inflow, outflow)``` parameter
with the x_, y_, z_boundary_condition parameters:

.. code-block:: python
    code = Athena()
    
    instance.parameters.x_boundary_conditions = ("periodic","periodic")
    instance.parameters.y_boundary_conditions = ("periodic","periodic")
    instance.parameters.z_boundary_conditions = ("periodic","periodic")

    
Custom boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a custom boundary condition by setting the boundary 
condition parameters to ```interface```. After these parameters have 
been set and commited you can change the boundary values by filling 
in the correct boundary grid. These boundary grids do not overlap 
but patch together to form a larger cuboid around the grid cuboid. 
The x-boundary conditions have N boundary cells in the x direction 
and the same amount of cells in the y and z direction as the grid. 
The y-boundary conditions have N boundary cells in the y direction 
and in the x direction it  has 2 * N + the number of cells in the x 
direction of the grid, in the z direction it has the same amount of 
cells as the grid. Finally the z-boundary conditions have N boundary 
cells in the z direction and in the x and y directions it  has 2 * N 
+ the number of cells in the x or y direction of the grid.

.. image:: boundaries3.png

You can get the boundary grid of a specific boundary by calling 
`get_boundary_grid` on the code. 

.. note::

    You fill the returned grid by copying over data from a memory 
    grid, as you can only set all attributes of the grid in one go 
    (you cannot set the individual attributes yet at we did not 
    implement the required methods, september 2012)

En example of filling the boundary grid:

    from amuse.lab import *
    
    instance=Athena()
    instance.parameters.mesh_size = (10 , 20, 10)
    instance.parameters.mesh_length = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] | generic_unit_system.length
    instance.parameters.x_boundary_conditions = ("interface", "outflow")
    
    # request the boundary grid
    # it will have shape of 4 x 20 x 10 (x, y, z)
    # as Athena has a 4 cell boundary depth
    xbound1_grid = instance.get_boundary_grid('xbound1')
    
    # copy the grid to memory, so we can manipulate it easier
    memxbound1 = xbound1_grid.copy_to_memory()
    
    # just set all cells in the grid to the same values
    memxbound1.rho = 0.02 | density
    memxbound1.rhovx = 0.2 | momentum
    memxbound1.rhovy = 0.0 | momentum
    memxbound1.rhovz = 0.0 | momentum
    memxbound1.energy =  p / (instance.parameters.gamma - 1)
    memxbound1.energy += 0.5 * (
            memxbound1.rhovx ** 2 +
            memxbound1.rhovy ** 2 + 
            memxbound1.rhovz ** 2 
        ) / memxbound1.rho
    
    # copy over the data so that the code has the correct
    # boundary values
    channel = memxbound1.new_channel_to(xbound1_grid)
    channel.copy()
    
A boundary grid connects to the grid in a very specific way. The 
general rule for the *1* or *inflow* boundaries is that the last 
cell of the boundary will connect to the first cell of the grid.  
The general rule for the *2* or *outflow* boundaries is that the 
first cell of the boundary will connect to the last cell of the grid.

For example for xbound1:

xbound1
    The left, inflow boundary on the x-axis. Will have cells ```[0, 
    # boundary cells - 1]``` in the x direction. The last cell of 
    the boundary will connect to the first cell of the grid.
ybound1. 
    The right, outflow boundary on the x-axis. Will have cells 
    ```[0, # boundary cells - 1]``` in the x direction. The first 
    cell of the boundary will connect to the last cell of the grid.
    
A boundary grid will have correct x, y and z positions that match the
grid. So, if a 1D grid starts at 0.0 and the cell size is 1.0, 
the last grid cell on the left(the inflow boundary) will have position -0.5.
 
    from amuse.lab import *
    
    instance=Athena()
    instance.parameters.mesh_size = (10 , 1, 1)
    instance.parameters.mesh_length = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] | generic_unit_system.length
    instance.parameters.x_boundary_conditions = ("interface", "interface")
    
    # request the boundary grid on both sides
    # it will have shape of 4 x 1 x 1 (x, y, z)
    # as Athena has a 4 cell boundary depth
    xbound1_grid = instance.get_boundary_grid('xbound1')
    xbound2_grid = instance.get_boundary_grid('xbound2')
    
    print xbound1_grid[...,0,0].x
    print instance.grid[...,0,0].x
    print xbound2_grid[...,0,0].x
