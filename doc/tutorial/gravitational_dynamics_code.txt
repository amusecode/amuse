Adding a Gravitational Dynamics Code
====================================

In this tutorial we explain the steps to take when integrating
a new gravitational dynamics code. 

.. warning::
    
    This tutorial will show the steps but will not finish in a
    working product. It will highlight the steps to take, we 
    recommend you first read these tutorials
    :doc:`c_code` and :doc:`fortran_code`.

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To simplify the work in the coming sections, we first define the 
environment variable 'AMUSEDIR'. This environment variable must 
point to the root directory of AMUSE (this is the directory 
containing the build.py script).

.. code-block:: bash

    > export AMUSEDIR=<path to the amuse root directory>
    
or in a c shell:

.. code-block:: csh

    > setenv AMUSEDIR <path to the amuse root directory>

After building the code, we want to run and test the code. Check if 
amuse is available in your python path by running the following code 
on the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    > python -c "import amuse"
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named amuse
    
If this code ends in a "ImportError" as shown in the example, the 
PYTHONPATH environment variable must be extended with the src directory
in AMUSEDIR. 
We can do so by using one of the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    > export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${AMUSEDIR}/src
    
or in a c shell:

.. code-block:: csh

    > setenv AMUSEDIR ${PYTHONPATH}:${AMUSEDIR}/src

Creating an initial directory structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First we need to create a directory for our project and put some 
files in it to help build the code. The fastest method to setup the 
directory is by using the build.py script.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    > # for C/C++ codes:
    > $AMUSEDIR/build.py --type=c --mode=dir CodeName
    > # for fortran codes:
    > $AMUSEDIR/build.py --type=f90 --mode=dir CodeName

.. note::

    The ```CodeName``` should be an unique name for your code. It
    should follow python rules for class names, start with
    an uppercase letter and have an uppercase letter for each word 
    in the name (camelcase).
    
This script will create a direcory called ```codename```. The script 
will populate the directory with a make file (```Makefile```), a python interface 
definition file (```interface.py```) and a C or fortran stub file 
(containing methods implementing the definitions in interface.py, 
```interface.cc``` or ```interface.f90```).

The src directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The build.py script creates a ```src``` directory in the ```codename```
directory. The ```src``` directory should contain a make file and
the sources of the code to integrate. (The build.py script also creates
some files in the ```src``` directory as an example, but you
can remove and overwrite everything in this directory)

The generated build system will call the make file with the 
```all``` target (to build an stand-alone executable, if available) 
and the ```libcodename.a``` target (to build a static library with 
all necessary object files).

.. note::
    
    If your code has a different build system or if the makefile is 
    not in the main directory of the code you need to edit the 
    generated make file in the ```codename``` directory. The AMUSE 
    codebase contains several codes that have a different build 
    system, please look into the code for ```evtwin``` (uses cmake) 
    or ```athena``` (downloads and patches code) for hints.

    
If you already have a make file, you might need to add the
```libcodename.a``` target. You can define this target by
adding the following code to your make file at the appropraite
locations in the makefile.

... code-block:: Makefile
    CODELIB = libcodename.a

    CODEOBJS = ...list of object files...

    AR = ar ruv
    RANLIB = ranlib

    $(CODELIB): $(CODEOBJS)
        $(RM) -f $@
        $(AR) $@ $(CODEOBJS)
        $(RANLIB) $@
