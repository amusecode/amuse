AMUSE supports storage classes that simply store the data in python lists and numpy arrays. AMUSE also supports storage classes that send messages to the codes to perform the actual storage and retrieval. At the script level the interface to these classes is all the same, so in normal use they behave the same. The performance of the different storage classes will vary, for a code storage the data may be sent over an internet connection causing slower reaction times. Smart usage of channels and caching data in memory sets will increase performance.\n",
