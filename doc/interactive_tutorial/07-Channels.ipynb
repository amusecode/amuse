    "Part of interaction between codes in AMUSE is based on exchanging data between the *community* codes or exchanging data between these codes and AMUSE. As you might have noticed in the pervious tutorial topic, every code provides access to particle collections or grids. The data of these collections or grids *live* inside the code, while the data of collections created in the script *live* inside the python process.\n",

    "<em>Background:</em> All data storage of particle collections (or grids) is implemented by different storage classes. AMUSE supports storage classes that simply store the data in python lists and numpy arrays. AMUSE also supports storage classes that send messages to the codes to perform the actual storage and retrieval. At the script level the interface to these classes is all the same, so in normal use they behave the same. The performance of the different storage classes will vary, for a code storage the data may be sent over an internet connection causing slower reaction times. Smart usage of channels and caching data in memory sets will increase performance.\n",
