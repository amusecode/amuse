    "In the AMUSE primer many more scripts are shown and the primer shows how to create more difficult and interesting interactions on a step by step basis. In this tutorial we will continue with showing the individual AMUSE framework tools and the general structure of interacting with a single code. The examples in the AMUSE primer focus on getting the science correct, where the tutorial will show you how to get the AMUSE syntax correct. For example in the above script we should think about when and how to take the timesteps, the mass loss should probably be a smooth function in time for the stellar dynamics to make sense (so smaller steps when interesting physics happens in a star). Considerations like these are handled in detail in the AMUSE primer."
