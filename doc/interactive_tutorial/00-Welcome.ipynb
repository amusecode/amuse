    "You are currently viewing the AMUSE tutorial. This is a [Jupyter Notebook web-application](https://jupyter.org/ \"Jupyter\"). With this application you can create, edit and run Python scripts on your local computer. We will be using it for these AMUSE tutorials, but you can use it for all your interactive explorations of Python and it's many libraries, scripts and applications. This first tutorial is for users unfamiliar with the notebook interface. We will assume some familiarity with Python, though not at very advanced level and even if you are not, you will probably be able to follow most examples and work out the exercises."
