Datamodel
==========================


Introduction
------------
The AMUSE datamodel is based on sets of particles. 

Different astrophysical objects are all
refered to as Particles in the AMUSE code. 
These objects can be:

* Star
* Black hole
* Gas Particle
* Dark Matter Particle

The astrophysical objects are all modelled using 
the ``Particle`` class . 
Objects of this class can have a varying set of attributes. These 
attributes can be defined by a script or a code.

Identity
--------
All particles have a unique 64-bit key. This key is generator
using a random number generator. The chances of duplicate keys
using 64-bit integers are finite but very low.This chance of a duplicate
key can be determined by a generalization of the birthday problem.

Duplicate keys::
    >>> # given n random integers drawn from a discrete uniform distribution 
    >>> # with range [1,highest_integer], what is the probability
    >>> # p(n;highest_integer) that at least two numbers are the same?
    >>> import math
    >>> number_of_bits = 64
    >>> highest_integer = 2**number_of_bits
    >>> number_of_particles = 1000000.0 # one million
    >>> probability = 1.0 - math.exp( (-number_of_particles * (number_of_particles - 1.0))/ (2.0* highest_integer) )
    >>> print probability
    2.71050268896e-08
    >>> # can also set the probablity and determine the set size
    >>> probability = 0.00001 # 0.001 percent
    >>> number_of_particles = math.sqrt(2 * highest_integer * math.log(1 / (1.0 - probability)))
    >>> print number_of_particles
    19207725.6894
    
If you use large sets or want to load a lot of simulations with different
particles into a script the probablity of encountering a duplicate
may be too high. An extension to more larger key sizes is planned but
not yet implemented. You can check for duplicates in a set of particles
by calling ``has_duplicates`` on a set.
    

Sets of particles
------------------
The AMUSE datamodel assumes all particles come in sets. The
data of a particle is stored in the set.
