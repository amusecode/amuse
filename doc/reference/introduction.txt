Introduction
=============


This document contains the reference documentation 
of the AMUSE framework. During the development period of AMUSE 
his document will be a  "Work in Progress". It will be updated to state
latests implementation. 

AMUSE
-----
AMUSE combines existing astrophysical numerical codes
into a single system. 

Goal
~~~~

To develop a toolbox for performing numerical astrophysical
experiments.  The toolbox provides:

* A standard way of input and output of astrophysical data.
* Support for set-up and management of numerical experiments.
* A unique method to couple a wide variety of physical codes
* A legacy set of standard, proven codes. These codes will be integrated 
  into AMUSE as modules. Each module can be used stand-alone or in
  combination with other modules
* A standard way for adding new modules to AMUSE.
* Examples to show the use of each module and possible couplings 
  between the modules.
* Documentation containing introduction, howto's and reference documents.


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
AMUSE development is planned to take place in a 2.5 year period. AMUSE 
is developed at the Leiden Observatory. The Leiden Observatory is
a faculty of the Leiden University in the Netherlands. Funding is provided
by NOVA grant number XXX.
