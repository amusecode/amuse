Introduction
------------
Codes in AMUSE evolve their models in three loops, the "inner",
the "outer" loop, and the "script" loop. The
"inner" loop is controlled by the code and evolves the model
in a sufficiently small step to limit errors
and be able to simulate important physics. The "outer" loop invokes
the "inner" loop until a condition is met specified by the AMUSE script.
The AMUSE script (or the "script" loops) interacts with the "outer"
loop.

 .. graphviz::

    digraph layers0 {
      fontsize=10.0;
      node [fontsize=10.0,shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow, width=1.5];
      subgraph cluster0 {
      fontsize=10.0;
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            labeljust="l";
            label="AMUSE Script";
            "script loop";
      }
      subgraph cluster1 {
      fontsize=10.0;
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            labeljust="l";
            label="Legacy Code";
            "outer loop";
            "inner loop";
      }
      "script loop" -> "outer loop"[minlen=2];
      "outer loop" -> "inner loop";

      "script loop" -> "script loop"  [dir="back", constraint=false,minlen=2, headport="se", tailport="ne"];
      "outer loop" -> "outer loop"[dir="back", constraint=false, headport="se", tailport="ne"];
      "inner loop" -> "inner loop"[dir="back", constraint=false, headport="se", tailport="ne"];
    }

In AMUSE the outer loop is always limited by the model time. Every
:func:`evolve` call has one argument, the model time. When the
simulation goes beyond this time, control is returned to the caller.
This process is shown in the following code example.

.. code-block:: c

    // example outer loop
    void outer_loop(double end_time)
    {
        while(model_time < end_time)
        {
            ...
            inner_loop()
            ...
            model_time += delta_time_for_this_step
        }
        return
    }

The model time is often enough to control the loop but some
situations call for an earlier break in the loop when the model
time has not reached the end time. To be able to break the outer loop
before the end time is reached, the framework supports
**stopping conditions**. The following code example
shows how these conditions might work in a C code.

.. code-block:: c

    // example outer loop with stopping conditions
    void outer_loop(double end_time)
    {
        int special_condition_was_met = 0;

        while(model_time < end_time)
        {
            ...
            inner_loop()
            ...
            check_if_special_conditions_are_met();
            ...
            model_time += delta_time_for_this_step
            ...
            if(special_condition_was_met) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return
    }

For example, a code might be able to detect a collision
of two stars and the user wants to handle this event.
If the code would proceed to the end time, the collision
is long over and the user has no way to know about
the collision and cannot handle it.

The **stopping conditions** framework in AMUSE
provides functionality for using and implementing stopping
conditions. This framework uses simple tables in the
codes and translates these tables to objects in the python
scripts. In the next section the use of this framework
is described. In the final section the implementation of
the framework in a legacy code is described.

Using stopping conditions
-------------------------

All interaction with the *stopping conditions* of a *legacy code*
is via the :attr:`stopping_conditions` attribute of a :class:`CodeInterface`
class. When the :attr:`stopping_conditions` attribute is
queried it returns a :class:`StoppingConditions` object. All
:class:`StoppingConditions` objects have an attribute for each
stopping condition supported by AMUSE. The
attributes have the following names:

collision_detection
    The outer loop breaks when two stars connect
pair_detection
    The outer loop breaks when two stars pair, possibly
    creating a binary star.
escaper_detection
    The outer loop breaks when a star escapes the
    simulation (is no longer gravitationally bound
    to the other stars)
timeout_detection
    The outer loop breaks when a certain amount
    of computer (wall-clock) time has elapsed.
number_of_steps_detection
    The outer loop breaks when a certain amount
    of steps (iterations) is reached.

.. note ::

    :class:`CodeInterface` objects provide a object oriented
    interface to the legacy codes.


All :class:`StoppingConditions` objects provide a string
representation describing the supported conditions and their
states.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from amuse.lab import *
    >>> code = Hermite()
    >>> print code.stopping_conditions
    Stopping conditions of a 'Hermite' object
    * supported conditions: collision_detection, pair_detection, timeout_detection
    * enabled conditions: none
    * set conditions: none
    >>> code.stop()

For every attribute the user can determine if it is
supported, if it was enabled or if it was hit during
the :func:`evolve` loop.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from amuse.lab import *
    >>> code = Hermite()
    >>> print code.stopping_conditions.collision_detection.is_supported()
    True
    >>> print code.stopping_conditions.collision_detection.is_enabled()
    False
    >>> print code.stopping_conditions.collision_detection.is_set()
    False
    >>> code.stop()

When a stopping condition was hit during the inner or outer loop evaluation
the user can query which particles were involved.
The particles involved are stored in columns.
For pair wise detections (collection and pair) the condition
provides two columns. The first column contains all the first particles
of the pairs and the second column contains all the second particles
of the pairs. These columns can be queried with the :meth:`particles`
method on a stopping condition attribute. This method takes one
argument, the column index and returns a particle subset with
the involved particles.

========  ============  ============
Pair      particles(0)  particles(1)
========  ============  ============
1 + 2     1              2
5 + 11    5              11
12 + 10   12             10
========  ============  ============

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from amuse.lab import *
    >>> code = Hermite()
    >>> sc = code.stopping_conditions.collision_detection
    >>> sc.enable()
    >>> code.evolve_model(0.1 | nbody_system.time)
    >>> print sc.is_set()
    True
    >>> print sc.particles(0)
    ...
    >>> pair = sc.particles(0)[0], sc.particles(1)[0]
    >>> code.stop()

Implementing stopping conditions
--------------------------------
All codes supporting stopping conditions
must implement the :class:`StoppingConditionInterface`
interface. This can be easily done by inheriting
from the :class:`StoppingConditionInterface` and implementing
all the functions defined in the interface:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyCodeInterface(LegacyInterface, StoppingConditionInterface):
        ...

This :class:`StoppingConditionInterface` interface models the interface to a
simple data model, best described as two tables:

Defined stopping conditions table
    This table list the types of stopping conditions
    and if these are supported by the code, and if so, if
    these are enabled by the user.

    ======  ========= ========
    type    supported enabled
    int     int       int
            read only read/write
    ======  ========= ========
    0       0         0
    1       1         0
    2       0         0
    3       1         0
    ======  ========= ========

    type
        The type of the stopping condition, integer between
        0 and N. defined by the framework
    supported
        1 if the stopping condition is supported, 0 otherwise.
        Needs to be set by the implementor
    enabled
        1 if enabled by the user, 0 otherwise.
        Implementor must provide a mechanism to set and unset
        this field.

Set stopping conditions table
    This table has a row for each stopping condition
    set during the outer and inner loop evaluations.
    Every row lists the type of condition set and which
    particles were involved (if any). The id of the
    last particle in the list must be -1.

    ======  =========== =========== ======= ============
    type    particle[0] particle(1) ...     particle(n)
    int     int         int         int     int
    ======  =========== =========== ======= ============
    1       1           2           -1      -1
    1       10          12          -1      -1
    3       -1          ...
    1       11          20          ...
    ...
    3       -1
    ======  =========== =========== ======= ============

    type
        The type of the stopping condition, integer between
        0 and N. defined by the framework. Set by the code
    particle(0...n)
        Index of the particle involved in the stopping condition.
        The index of the last particle must be -1

.. autoclass:: amuse.support.legacy.stopping_conditions.StoppingConditionInterface
    :members:

This interface contains a lot of functions and implementing it
might be a time consuming task. To help implementing the
interface, AMUSE provides a C library that does most of the
table management, this library is described in the next section.

Using the stopping conditions library
-------------------------------------
The stopping conditions tables are implemented as a
static C library. This library is part of the AMUSE distribution
and can be found in the ```lib/stopcond``` directory.

The library implements *all* functions of the :class:`StoppingConditionInterface`
interface and provides a number functions for the
legacy code implementer to actually set and support
stopping conditions. The library does not implement any
stopping condition detection routines. These have to
be implemented on a per code basis. The functionality
of the library is limited to managing the stopping conditions
tables and the library has to be controlled by the code
so that stopping conditions are set.

The library implements the defined stopping conditions table as
three long integers. These integers are used as bitmaps (the state
of individual bits is used to determine if a condition is true or
false). The individual bits can be tested with the following
macros:

.. data:: COLLISION_DETECTION_BITMAP

.. data:: PAIR_DETECTION_BITMAP

.. data:: ESCAPER_DETECTION_BITMAP

.. data:: TIMEOUT_DETECTION_BITMAP

.. data:: NUMBER_OF_STEPS_BITMAP

The three variables are not accessible directly from FORTRAN
codes. The stopping condition library has special functions
for FORTRAN to access them. 

The three global variables are:

.. c:var:: long enabled_conditions

Individual bits are set when the user enables a stopping condition.
Access in FORTRAN through:

.. code-block:: fortran

    INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
    INTEGER:: is_stopping_condition_enabled
    INTEGER:: is_collision_detection_enabled
    INTEGER:: error
    error = is_stopping_condition_enabled(COLLISION_DETECTION, is_collision_detection_enabled)

.. c:var:: long set_conditions

Individual bits are set when the a condition is detected by the
code. (the :c:func:`set_stopping_condition_info` will fill
this bitmap). Access in FORTRAN:

.. code-block:: fortran

    INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
    INTEGER:: is_stopping_condition_set
    INTEGER:: is_collision_detection_set
    INTEGER:: error
    error = is_stopping_condition_set(COLLISION_DETECTION, is_collision_detection_set)

.. c:var:: long supported_conditions

.. code-block:: fortran

     set_supported_conditions()
 
Individual bits are set for supported conditions. This global
must be defined by the code. 

For a code that support
collision detection and timeout detection the variable can
be defined in c as:

    .. code-block:: c

        set_support_for_condition(COLLISION_DETECTION);
        set_support_for_condition(PAIR_DETECTION);

or in FORTRAN as:
    .. code-block:: fortran

        INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
        
        set_support_for_condition(COLLISION_DETECTION)
        set_support_for_condition(PAIR_DETECTION)

To refer to the type of a stopping condition, the library defines the
following macros:

.. data:: COLLISION_DETECTION

.. data:: PAIR_DETECTION

.. data:: ESCAPER_DETECTION

.. data:: TIMEOUT_DETECTION

.. data:: NUMBER_OF_STEPS_DETECTION

The following four functions can be used to set and reset
the stopping conditions.

.. c:function:: int reset_stopping_conditions()

    Resets all stopping conditions. Needs to be called just
    before entering the outer_loop

    .. code-block:: c

        void outer_loop(double end_time)
        {
            reset_stopping_conditions()
            while(model_time < end_time)
            {
                ...
            }
        }

.. c:function:: int next_index_for_stopping_condition()

    Reserves a row on the stopping conditions table.
    Needs to be called after detecting a stopping condition so
    that the code can fill in the stopping condition information.

    .. code-block:: c

        if(COLLISION_DETECTION_BITMAP & enabled_conditions) {
            int row = next_index_for_stopping_condition();
            set_stopping_condition_info(row, COLLISION_DETECTION);
            ...
        }

.. c:function:: int set_stopping_condition_info(int index, int type)

    Sets the type of stopping condition encountered for
    the given row index. Use one of the predefined type macros
    for the type argument

    .. code-block:: c

        set_stopping_condition_info(row, COLLISION_DETECTION);


.. c:function:: int set_stopping_condition_particle_index(int index, int column_index, int index_of_particle)

    Sets the id of a particles involved in the stopping
    conditionion (only needed for stopping conditions with particles)

    .. code-block:: c

        set_stopping_condition_info(row, COLLISION_DETECTION);
        set_stopping_condition_particle_index(stopping_index, 0, ident[i]);
        set_stopping_condition_particle_index(stopping_index, 1, ident[j]);

Stopping condtions with parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *timeout* and *number of steps* stopping conditions are parameter
based, i.e. the conditions are met if the outer loop took a certain time
or a reached a certain number of steps (iterations). The parameters are
accessed through the following procedures:

.. c:function:: int set_stopping_condition_timeout_parameter(double value); 

    Sets the computer (wall-clock) time parameter.

.. c:function:: get_stopping_condition_timeout_parameter(double *value);

    Gets the computer (wall-clock) time parameter.

.. c:function:: int set_stopping_condition_number_of_steps_parameter(int value);

    Sets the number of steps parameter.

.. c:function:: int get_stopping_condition_number_of_steps_parameter(int *value);

    Gets the number of steps parameter.

For MPI enabled codes, the stopping conditions must be distributed
and collected. The following three functions can be used to
manage the MPI communication.

.. c:function:: int mpi_setup_stopping_conditions()

    Setups some globals for MPI communication, this needs
    to be called once per code execution (for example
    in a :func:`initialize_code` function)

.. c:function:: int mpi_distribute_stopping_conditions()

    Distributes the state of the conditions, so each process
    knows which conditions are enabled by the user. Needs
    to be called when the parallel code is entered (and all
    other data is distributed).


.. c:function:: int mpi_collect_stopping_conditions()

    Collects the individual tables of the set conditions and
    combines these to one table on the root process (MPI rank
    == 0). Needs to be called at the end of the parallel part
    of the code.

The procedure for adding stopping conditions is explained by
the following steps.

1.  Add compiler and linker flags to the build script or
    Makefile.

    To use the ```stopcond``` library, the compile and link steps
    of the legacy code must be changed. The following compiler flags
    need to be added::

        -I$(AMUSE_DIR)/lib/stopcond

    For the link step the following linker flags are needed::

        -L$(AMUSE_DIR)/lib/stopcond -lstopcondmpi

2.  Include the header file and defining the globals

    The name of the header file is "stopcond.h" and
    this header file needs to be included in all
    files referring to the stopping conditions.

    .. code-block:: c

        #include <stopcond.h>

    The legacy code should take care of the setting
    of the :c:data:`supported_conditions` bitmap
    in its initialization, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: c

        set_support_for_condition(COLLISION_DETECTION);
        set_support_for_condition(PAIR_DETECTION);

    In FORTRAN include "stopcond.inc" in subroutines that
    require the constants.
    
    .. code-block:: fortran
    
        INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
        set_support_for_condition(COLLISION_DETECTION)
        set_support_for_condition(PAIR_DETECTION)

3.  Check for a condition when it is enabled and set the condition
    if found. In c:

    .. code-block:: c

        int is_collision_detection_enabled;
        is_stopping_condition_enabled(COLLISION_DETECTION, &is_collision_detection_enabled);
    
        if(is_collision_detection_enabled)
        {
            real sum_of_the_radii = radius_of_star[i] + radius_of_star[j];
            if (distance_between_stars <= sum_of_the_radii)
            {
                int stopping_index  = next_index_for_stopping_condition();
                set_stopping_condition_info(stopping_index, COLLISION_DETECTION);
                set_stopping_condition_particle_index(
                    stopping_index,
                    0,
                    identifier_of_star[i]
                );
                set_stopping_condition_particle_index(
                    stopping_index,
                    1,
                    identifier_of_star[j]
                );
            }
        }

    and in FORTRAN:

    .. code-block:: fortran

        INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
	INTEGER::is_stopping_conditions_enabled
        INTEGER::is_collision_detection_enabled, stopping_index
        INTEGER::error
        
        error = is_stopping_condition_enabled(COLLISION_DETECTION, is_collision_detection_enabled)
        !...
        IF is_collision_detection_enabled.EQ.1 THEN
          IF there_is_a_collision THEN
            stopping_index = next_index_for_stopping_conditions()
            error = set_stopping_condition_info(stopping_index, COLLISION_DETECTION)
        !...
          ENDIF
        ENDIF          

4.  Break the outer loop when any condition is set. The
    :c:data:`set_conditions` can be tested:

    .. code-block:: c

        while(...) {
            ...
            if(set_conditions)
            {
                break;
            }
        }

    .. code-block:: fortran

        INCLUDE "../../lib/stopcond/stopcond.inc"
        INTEGER::is_any_condition_set
        DO WHILE ()
        !...   
          IF (is_any_condition_set().EQ.1) EXIT
          
        END DO 


A good example of a code implementing the stopping conditions
is the "hermite0" legacy code. The code can be found
in the 'src/amuse/legacy/hermite0' directory.
