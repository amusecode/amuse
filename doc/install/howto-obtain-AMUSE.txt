Obtaining AMUSE
===============

Download
--------

Go to the `downloads <http://www.amusecode.org/trac/wiki/releases>`_ page.

Getting started
---------------

The first step in getting AMUSE to work is obtaining the AMUSE
source code. We advice you to do this even before installation of the 
prerequisite software (:ref:`prerequisite-label`). In the following 
installation instructions we assume that you will install AMUSE in a 
directory ``/amuse``. 

Releases
--------

For the official releases we provide tarballs and subversion 
repository access (you need an account for the latter).

You can find us on google groups, http://groups.google.com/group/amusecode 
or on IRC at the #amuse channel on irc.freenode.net. 

Tarball
~~~~~~~

Obtain the tarball (e.g. amuse-8.1.tar.gz) from the download-site and unpack it 
in the amuse directory using:

.. code-block:: sh

    > tar -xf amuse-8.1.tar.gz

this will make an amuse sub-directory ``amuse-8.1``, which we will be referring to as
the AMUSE root directory, e.g.:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    ./amuse
    +-- amuse-8.1
        |-- bin
     	|-- build.py
    	|-- configure
    	|-- cuda_self_help
   	+-- data
    	|-- doc
    	|-- lib
    	|-- Makefile
    	|-- MANIFEST.in
    	|-- README.txt
    	|-- sandbox
    	|-- setup.py
    	|-- slowtests
    	|-- src
    	|-- support
    	|-- test
    	|-- test_results

From here proceed by reading the  :ref:`prerequisite-label` section.

Bleeding edge
-------------

The current development version is available via subversion repository access 
by issuing the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    > svn co http://www.amusecode.org/svn/trunk amuse-svn

This will make an AMUSE root directory with the name "amuse-svn".
