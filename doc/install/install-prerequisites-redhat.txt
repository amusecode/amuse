Installing on RedHat (CentOS, Fedora)
=====================================

Installing on CentOS 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we asume a minimal CentOS 6 installation.

All
---
The prerequisites can be installed with a couple of commands
on CentOS 6. 

To install the prerequisites do (for base-devel select *all* members)::

    > sudo yum install make gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran \
	cmake zlib-devel\
	openmpi openmpi-devel \
	fftw fftw-devel \
	gsl gsl-devel gmp
	
After installing openmpi, you need to activate it using the 'module'
command::
    
    > module load openmpi-$(uname -i)

.. note::

    We recommend to put the openmpi module activation script
    in your .bashrc or .cshrc file.

Install python and dependencies::

    > sudo yum install python-devel \
	docutils python-nose \
	numpy numpy-f2py\
	python-docutils

To install hdf5 and docutils first install an additional rpm forge.
For documentation see http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge

After installing an rpm forge do::

    > sudo yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel
    
To install h5py do::

    > sudo easy_install h5py
    
Last, you need to install mpi4py with::

    > su -
    > module load openmpi-$(uname -i)
    > easy_install mpi4py

.. note::
    
    The default CentOS sudo policy resets the environments variables and
    thereby removes the openmpi settings. So for the last step
    you cannot use ```sudo easy_install mpi4py``` but must install
    under root directly.


Installing on Fedora 11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we asume a live-cd install of Fedora 11 installation.

Python
------
Fedora comes with python2.6 pre-installed, you can check if
python is installed by doing:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python --version
	Python 2.6.2

If this failes with an error or a version before 2.6, please install 
python first(the package is called ``python``). You also need 
the ``python-devel`` development package.
To install it, do::

    > sudo yum install python-devel
    

GCC
---
By default, Fedora does not install a fortran 90 or a C++ compiler. We
suggest using gfortran and g++. These compilers are installed with
the ``gcc``, ``gcc-c++`` and the ``gcc-gfortran`` packages. 
To install these, do::

    > sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran

MPI2
----
Fedora comes with packages for MPICH2 and Openmpi.

To install MPICH2, do::
    
    > sudo yum install mpich2 mpich2-devel

If you prefer OpenMpi over MPICH2, you can install openmpi
from the Fedora yum database. 
To install the openmpi packages, do::

     > sudo yum install openmpi openmpi-devel

HDF5
----
Amuse can work with HDF5 versions 1.6.* and 1.8.3. Fedora 11 has a package
with HDF5 version 1.8.3. To install it, do::

    > sudo yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel

FFTW
-------
On Fedora, FFTW can be installed with::

    > sudo yum install fftw fftw-devel

GSL
-------
On Fedora, GSL can be installed with::

    > sudo yum install gsl gsl-devel

CMake
-------
CMake is used to build EVTwin. On Fedora, CMake can be installed with::

    > sudo yum install cmake

GMP
-------
GMP is required for Adaptb. On Fedora, GMP can be installed with::

    > sudo yum install gmp

MPFR
-------
MPFR is required for Adaptb. On Fedora, MPFR is currently included in the gmp 
package. So, if you have not already done so, MPFR can be installed with::

    > sudo yum install gmp

Python packages in Fedora
-------------------------
Fedora comes with python packages for nose and numpy. You also need 
the setuptools package to be able to install the ``mpi4py`` and ``h5py`` 
software. To install these , do::

    > sudo yum install python-nose numpy numpy-f2py \
        python-setuptools python-setuptools-devel

Python packages with easy_install
---------------------------------
The ``mpi4py``, ``h5py`` and ``docutils`` can be 
installed with the ``easy_install`` command::

    > sudo easy_install mpi4py
    > sudo easy_install h5py
    > sudo easy_install docutils
