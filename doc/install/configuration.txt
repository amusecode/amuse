Configuring AMUSE
=================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In AMUSE a configuration script is used to for two purposes; to run 
on different operating systems and to set compile time options. The 
AMUSE framework has been built on Linux, AIX and OS X systems, it 
also runs on Windows. AMUSE can be configured to run with or without 
MPI, GPU (CUDA) and openmp. In this document we will provide a short 
overview of the configuration options and their effects.


Basic
~~~~~
The basic configuration of AMUSE uses MPI as the communication 
channel, does not build any GPU enabled codes (or GPU enabled 
versions) and uses openmp if available.  The configuration script
can be run as::

    > ./configure
    
To get a list of options and important environment variablse run 
```configure``` with the help flag::

    > ./configure --help
    
A very important variable for the configuration script is the 
location of the python executable. The python executable is searched 
for in the PATH and you can override it by setting the ```PYTHON``` 
environment variable::

    > ./configure PYTHON=/path/to/libraries/python
 
The configuration script will look for dependent libraries in 
default locations of the system and, if defined, also in directories 
under the ```PREFIX``` environment variable. If you installed the 
prerequisites with the AMUSE installion scripts (see 
:doc:`howto-install-prerequisites`), the configuration script should 
find all the packages installed. For most libraries the 
```PREFIX/lib``` or ```PREFIX/lib64``` is searched before the system 
path. You can override the ```PREFIX``` environment variable::
   
    > ./configure PREFIX=/path/to/libraries/root

GPU
~~~

Currently all codes in AMUSE capable of using the GPU are based 
on CUDA. To run these codes you will need CUDA libraries and drivers.
Once these have been installed you can run configure like so::

    > ./configure --enable-cuda

The configuration script will look for the ```nvcc``` compiler and the 
cuda libraries, in well known paths. Unfortunately it often will not find
the cuda tools and you have to specify the some environment variables or
configuration options. 

If the configuration script cannot find the nvcc compiler (or if it 
finds the wrong one) you can specify the nvcc compiler with the 
```NVCC``` environment variable::

    > ./configure --enable-cuda NVCC=/path/to/nvcc
    
The configure script also searches for the nvcc compiler in the 
```$CUDA_TK/bin``` directory::

    > ./configure --enable-cuda CUDA_TK=/opt/nvidia
    
The configure script looks for cuda and cudart libraries in 
```$NVCC/../lib``` or ```$NVCC/../lib64```, if your libraries cannot 
be found there you can override the library path with::

    > ./configure --enable-cuda --with-cuda-libdirs=/path/to/cuda/lib
    
Using ```--with-cuda-libdirs``` will always override the local 
search paths and should also work if you have an old version of cuda 
in ```/usr/lib```.

Finally, if all else fails, you can edit the ```config.mk``` file 
after configure has finished. The important variables in the file are:

 * CUDA_ENABLED, valid values are "yes" or "no".
 * NVCC, absolute path to the nvcc executable.
 * CUDA_TK, directory of the cuda toolkit installation
 * CUDA_LIBS, library flags the add in the linking stage (-L/path -lcuda -lcudart)
 
Please remember that the ```config.mk``` file is overwritten 
every time configure is run.

Sapporo library version
-----------------------
 
The Sapporo library will be build when CUDA is enabled. The Sapporo 
library implements the GRAPE6 API on GPU hardware. AMUSE is shipped 
with two versions of the Sapporo library:

 * An older version ```sapporo_light``` that runs on most CUDA devices but is not maintained any longer
 * The latests version ```sapporo``` that runs on modern GPU harware. This version should also run on 
   OpenCL devices but this is still a work in progress.

By default AMUSE will use the older ```sapporo_light``` version, to enable
the latests version do::

    > ./configure --enable-cuda --enable-sapporo2
