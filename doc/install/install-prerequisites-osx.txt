Installing on OS X
******************

Installing on MAC OS X with MacPorts 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we asume a clean MacPorts installation. The MacPorts
build system will build every package from source so installation 
will be slow. The packages in MacPorts support different *variants*, each
*variant* is build differently. The default *variant* of most packages
does not support fortran and AMUSE needs fortran and fortran enabled
packages. Below, with all installation commands we will specify the variant.
AMUSE is tested with the gcc45 variant, gcc43 and gcc44 have been known 
to work also. Below, we will use gcc45.

.. note::
    
    If you want to use a different fortran compiler (ifort), you are better 
    of using the **install.py** script in the **doc/install** directory.

.. note::

    Make sure you have a recent MacPorts installation. You need at least
    an up to date MacPorts 1.8.6 or later. 
    
.. note::
    
    If you are unsure of your installation you can uninstall and clear the 
    packages with::
    
        port uninstall py26-docutils py26-nose py26-mpi4py py26-h5py py26-numpy hdf5-18 fftw-3 gsl openmpi python26
        
    or, for python 2.7::
    
        port uninstall py27-docutils py27-nose py27-mpi4py py27-h5py py27-numpy hdf5-18 fftw-3 gsl openmpi python27
    
    To make a clean install of MacPorts, please remove the 
    MacPorts directory and read the guide at:
    http://guide.macports.org/
    
All in one
----------

You can install all the packages described below in one go with::

    > sudo port install gcc45
    
    > sudo port install python27
    > sudo port install openmpi +gcc45
    > sudo port install fftw-3 +gcc45
    > sudo port install hdf5-18 gsl cmake gmp mpfr
    > sudo port install py27-numpy py27-h5py py27-nose py27-docutils +gcc45
    
    > sudo port install py27-mpi4py +openmpi
    
    > sudo port install py27-matplotlib +gcc45
    
After installing you will need to configure the code with the following line::

    > ./configure --with-fftw=/opt/local \
                  MPICXX=openmpicxx MPICC=openmpicc MPIFC=openmpif90 \
                  FC=gfortran-mp-4.5 PYTHON=python2.7 \
                  PREFIX=/opt/local
                  
.. note::

    The ``--with-fftw`` option will ensure that fftw is found in 
    ``/opt/local`` and not in any other location on OS X. Often, incompatible versions of
    fftw will be installed in ``/usr/include`` or ``/usr/local/inlude``. These versions may
    have the wrong processor type (32 vs 64bits) or not contain a fortran API. For both cases
    compiling ``Fi`` will fail.      
    In case the configure script does not pick the wanted fftw directories, you
    can edit the ``config.mk`` file to point to the right version.
    

.. note::

    The ``PREFIX`` variable will make sure some support libraries for 
    community codes (gsl, gmp and mpfr) are found in ``/opt/local``.

.. note::

    Please, make sure you have no other compile variables specified
    (like CC or CXX or CFLAGS), unless you have customized MacPorts in
    any way. Some variable settings will likely give compile errors
    for the community codes. 
    
    For example, BHTree is compiled with openmpicxx and $CXX. 
    The command in the CXX variable must be compatible 
    with openmpicxx (you can do ``openmpicxx --show`` to get 
    the command openmpicxx is using)


.. note::

    The version of openmpi in macports (1.5.5 and before) does not 
    handle MPI_IN_PLACE calls correctly for Fortran codes. 
    Unfortunately, this means that **Capreole**, **PhiGrape** and 
    **Mocassin** will not work with more than one worker on the mac. 
    Also, **MpiAmrVac**, will give incorrect results in any case. 
    
    If you want to run these codes on OS X, please use the amuse install
    scripts and make sure macports is not on your path.
    
.. warning::
    
    With macports,  the nose package will not install ``nosetests`` 
    under it's standard name. It will be named 
    ``nosetests-<python-version>``. So for python2.7 you'll need to 
    use *nosetests-2.7*
    
    .. code-block:: sh
    
        > nosetests-2.7
        ............................................
        
        OK
        
GCC
---
By default MacPorts uses the XCode compilers, these compilers have no support
for fortran, a MacPorts gcc compiler set needs to be installed. We suggest
installing gcc 4.5:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > sudo port install gcc45
    
.. note::
    
    If you have installed a different version of gcc, you need to select
    a different variant of the packages below. To select a different variant
    replace **+gcc44** with **+gcc43**, **+gcc42** or any other version
    matching your gcc installation. Note, apple-gcc versions will not work,
    these do not support fortran.

Python
------
MacPorts supports several python versions in different variants, we will install
the python27 versions

.. code-block:: sh

    > sudo port install python27 +gcc45
   
MPI2
----
MacPorts provides packages for mpich2 and openmpi. Although you can
probably install both, this is not recommended. We suggest you install
openmpi.

To install openmpi, do::

     > sudo port install openmpi +gcc45

HDF5
----
Amuse can work with HDF5 versions 1.6.* and 1.8.3. MacPorts comes
with HDF5 version 1.8.*. To install it, do::

    > sudo port install hdf5-18 +gcc45 

FFTW-3
------
MacPorts comes with a FFTW and FFTW-3 package, for AMUSE we need FFTW-3.
FFTW-3 can be installed with::

    > sudo port install fftw-3 +gcc45

GSL
---
GSL is used to build Gadget2, GSL can be installed with::

    > sudo port install gsl +gcc45

CMake
-----
CMake is used to build EVTwin, CMake can be installed with::

    > sudo port install cmake

GMP
-------
GMP is required for Adaptb. With MacPorts, GMP can be installed with::

    > sudo port install gmp

MPFR
-------
MPFR is required for Adaptb. With MacPorts, MPFR can be installed with::

    > sudo port install mpfr


Python packages
---------------
By this point all libraries and frameworks are installed. We can now
install python packages (some depend on the installed libraries)::

    > sudo port install py27-numpy py27-h5py py27-nose py27-docutils +gcc45

If you installed openmpi in the MPI2 step you need to set the
"openmpi" variant for "py27-mpi4py"::

    > sudo port install py27-mpi4py +openmpi


Matplotlib
----------
Matplotlib is not required but is very useful for creating graphics, 
you can install it with::

    > sudo port install py27-matplotlib +gcc45
    

.. note::

    Macports will install the compilers under non standard names. To
    use the right compilers you need to specify these during the
    configure stage of AMUSE.
    
    See the output for ``configure --help`` for a list of all 
    environment variables you can set.
    
    If you installed openmpi you need to specify the mpi compilers 
    like so::
    
        ./configure MPICXX=openmpicxx MPICC=openmpicc MPIFC=openmpif90
