===================================
Installation of the AMUSE software
===================================

Before installing AMUSE the prerequisite software must be downloaded and
installed, see :ref:`prerequisite-label`.

In the current stage of development AMUSE will not be installed in 
the python ``site-packages`` library. Instead, all code is build 
in the AMUSE source directories. With this setup we can easily edit
the code and run it, without the need for an extra installation step.


Configuring the code
--------------------
The code is configured using the ``configure`` command. 
Before building the code, run 'configure' in the AMUSE
root directory.

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > configure
    
The 'configure' script will check for all prerequisite software
and report if any are missing.

Building the code
-----------------

The code is build using a  ``Makefile``. To build the code run 'make'
in the AMUSE root directory.

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > make clean
    > make
    ...
    legacy codes build
    ==================
    * sse
    * hermite0
    * bhtree
    * phiGRAPE
    running generate_main

If everything goes well all legacy codes will be build (sse, hermite0, 
bhtree and phiGRAPE).

Testing the build
-----------------

Before testing the code, the `mpd` process daemon must be started. The
`mpd` application manages the creation of MPI processes. If this is
the first time the MPICH2 daemon is run it will complain about a 
missing ``.mpd.conf`` file. Please follow the instructions printed
by the mpd daemon.

.. code-block:: sh
    
    >> mpd &

After starting `mpd` we can start the tests.

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > nosetests
    ............................................
    Ran 91 tests in 12.013s

    OK

.. compound::
    
    On some laptops the hostname will not point
    to the correct internet address. For these laptops 
    you can start the mpd daemon on the localhost ip. To do so,
    you need to set the ``--ifhn`` option::
    
        >> mpd --ifhn localhost &
        
    
    



Real-time testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The code includes support for real-time testing. The real-time testing 
application monitors the files in the source directories ('src' 
and 'test'). Every time a file is changed it will run most of the tests.
After each test a report is created, this report can be viewed with
a web browser.

.. code-block:: sh

    # go to the AMUSE root directory
    # display help information of the realtime_test script
    >  python -m support.realtime_test --help
    Usage: realtime_test.py [options]

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -p PORT, --port=PORT  start serving on PORT
      
    # start the python realtime_test script on port 9080
    > python -m support.realtime_test -p 9080
    starting server on port:  9080
    start test run
    ...
    # open a browser to view the results
    > firefox http://localhost:9080/
    

Running the code
----------------
A python script will not find the AMUSE code as the code is not 
installed into the python 'site-packages' directory or any other 
directory that can be found by python automatically. 

During a build a shell script is created to run the AMUSE code. To 
use this script you first have to copy it to a directory in your PATH.
The script is called ''amuse.sh''. After copying this script you can run
amuse code from anywhere on your disk by starting 'amuse.sh'. This
script has exactly the same command line parameters as the normal python
application.
