Installing on Ubuntu version 18.04 with Python 3.6
==================================================

In this section we assume a default Ubuntu desktop installation.

Installing prerequisites
------------------------
These prerequisites are essential for building AMUSE and the community codes.
They can be installed system-wide with the commands below.
You can choose between openmpi and mpich as desired, both work with AMUSE.

For openmpi do::

  > sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran python3-dev \
	  libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin \
	  libgsl0-dev cmake libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev \
	  libgmp3-dev libmpfr4 libmpfr-dev \
	  libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools \
	  git

For mpich do::
	
  > sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran python3-dev \
	  mpich libmpich-dev \
	  libgsl0-dev cmake libfftw3-3 libfftw3-dev \
	  libgmp3-dev libmpfr4 libmpfr-dev \
	  libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools \
	  git

.. note:
  Please make sure not to install mpich and openmpi together. 
  When both are installed strange errors will occur and AMUSE will not work.
  If you have both installed please first remove both and then install one.

  
Installing AMUSE
----------------

First, create a virtual environment to install AMUSE and other desired Python packages in.
This ensures that you don't need root privileges and that your AMUSE environment is isolated from other system-installed packages.

To create the virtual environment, do (from a desired directory)::

  > python3 -m venv Amuse-env
  
When the environment is created, you can activate it with::

  > . Amuse-env/bin/activate

You may want to make an alias for this, e.g.::

  > alias amuse-env='. ~/virtualenvironments/Amuse-env/bin/activate'
  
From this point, your prompt will have 'Amuse-env' in front of it, so you will always know when you're in this virtual environment.

Now you can use pip to install the prerequisite python modules for AMUSE::

  > pip install numpy nose docutils mpi4py h5py
  
Probably, you'll want to install these Python modules too::

  > pip install scipy astropy jupyter pandas seaborn
  
Now we can finally install AMUSE itself.
First, download AMUSE or preferably make a git clone (in a desired directory)::

  > git clone https://github.com/amusecode/amuse.git

Then, change to the AMUSE directory and run configure, enabling optional GPU features if present/required::

  > cd amuse
  > ./configure [--enable-cuda] [--enable-sapporo2]

Finally, build and install AMUSE, with optionally downloaded codes if desired::

  > [export DOWNLOAD_CODES=1]
  > python setup.py install

.. note:
  The part below does not currently work in a Python 3 environment. Please skip it for now.

Optionally, to test if your setup was successful, run (this will take a long time)::

  > python setup.py test
