FI N-body/SPH code & AMUSE interface

FI is a parallel TreeSPH code for galaxy simulations. Extensively 
rewritten, extended and parallelized it is a development from code from 
Jeroen Gerritsen and Roelof Bottema, which itself goes back to Treesph. 

Note that some features are not working atm. These may be fixed in the 
future. (and I will think of a better name)
