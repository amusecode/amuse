  GADGET is a freely available code for cosmological N-body/SPH 
  simulations on massively parallel computers with distributed 
  memory. 

  GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree 
  algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh 
  scheme for long-range gravitational forces, currently not 
  supported from the AMUSE interface) and represents fluids by 
  means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can 
  be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations 
  that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with 
  or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types 
  of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-
  gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas 
  dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation 
  and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive, with a 
  dynamic range which is, in principle, unlimited.
