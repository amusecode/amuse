octgrav module for MUSE

octgrav is a gravitational tree code (analgous to BHTree) which uses a
GPU to calculate gravitational accelerations & potentials.

Problem: python is very slow in loading large data files. For N >
32768, it takes very long time to get data file loaded :)

Basic requirement is to have CUDA Toolkit & SDK ver >= 1.1. The
CUDA-enabled GPU is not required for test, but a must for production
runs. 

By default, the code is compiled in --device-emulation mode.  To
enable use of CUDA device, "--device-emulation" has to be removed from
$CODEPATH/Makefile.

The actual tree-code can easily be replaced by a newever version: it
is enough to untar a new distribution in src/ folder, and to change
CODEPATH variable in Makefile.
