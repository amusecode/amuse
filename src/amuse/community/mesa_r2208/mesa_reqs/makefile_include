# NetCDF is a binary data file format for storing array-oriented scientific 
# data.  The version used here is NetCDF 4, which is built on HDF5, so if you 
# wish to enable this feature, you will need to build HDF5 1.8 or later before 
# building NetCDF.  HDF5, in turn, requires zlib, so you'll potentially need 
# to build all three of these if you don't have them already.  Please see 
# instructions at their respective web sites:
#
# NetCDF: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/
# HDF5:   http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
#
# Be sure to use the "--enable-netcdf-4" option when running ./configure on 
# NetCDF -- the new version 4 features are not enabled by default.
#
# Once finished building these, it is best to "make check" to be sure that 
# your builds worked before moving on.
#
# Also note that the organization of the resulting NetCDF file 
# (star/test/LOGS/star.nc) is still tentatitive, as this is a very new 
# feature (just added on Feb 2, 2009), so it is possible that it will change 
# in the future.  Please bear this in mind.
#
# Please contact Jonathan Tomshine with questions/comments/problems regarding 
# this feature: yahoo.com, jrtomshine (at)
