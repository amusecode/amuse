This one is a bit tricky, and it's only somewhat working, so here are some notes.

- The wrapper is currently set up to only work in develop mode, as it doesn't get the
  data directories in the right way.
- The standard hatchling-based installation can't do develop installs. We need a
  solution for that. This has a hack in it, but that's not going to be good to releas.
- The worker compiles, and the tests run against the hacked install, so at least the
  wrapper build system has been replaced.
