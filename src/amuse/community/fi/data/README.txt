This is the Fi data directory.

The subdirectory 'input' contains data files available by default, like:
uvpol* : files containing precalculated uv kernels
*.cool: electron impact cooling functions 
*.Hcool: H impact cooling functions
*.starprop: stellar synthesis models
*.halo: halo files

The subdirectory 'output' is initially empty, and is used to store temporary data files, and other output such as log files.
