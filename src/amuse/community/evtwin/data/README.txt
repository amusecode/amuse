This is the EVTwin data directory.

The subdirectory 'input' contains data files available by default, like some ZAMS (zero age main sequence) models. It's also used to store newly created (ZAMS) models.

The subdirectory 'output' is initially empty, and is used to store temporary data files, and other output such as log files.
