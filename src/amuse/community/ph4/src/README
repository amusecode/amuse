Programs contained in the src directory
---------------------------------------

Several related but independent programs are bundled together in the
src directory.  They interoperate within ph4, but also can run
standalone.  Ultimately they should become separate modules within
AMUSE.  All are built using Makefile.ph4.

1. ph4: parallel, GPU accelerated, 4th-order Hermite integrator,
   interfaced with AMUSE as the ph4 module, but also runs as a
   standalone program.

   Files: parallel_hermite_4.cc, jdata.[ch]*, idata.[ch]*,
	  scheduler.[ch]*, grape.[ch]*, gpu.cc, util.cc, diag.cc,
	  debug.cc.

   NOTE: ph4 can run in numerous modes.  In principle, they should
	 all be equivalent...

	(i)   The standalone programs are parallel_hermite_4 and
	      parallel_hermite_4_noPGU, compiled with and without the
	      -DGPU option, respectively.  In addition, GPU use can be
	      be suppressed at run-time in parallel_hermite_4 by using
	      the -g flag.  Since suppressing an option is not
	      necessarily the same as not compiling it in in the first
	      place, all three options should be tested when verifying
	      the code:

		    parallel_hermite_4
		    parallel_hermite_4 -g
		    parallel_hermite_4_noGPU

	(ii)  These programs can be run serial or parallel, e.g.

		    mpiexec -n 4 parallel_hermite_4 ...

	      Running with "-n 1" is equivalent to just typing

		    parallel_hermite_4 ...

	      All GPU options are supported in all parallel versions.

	(iii) The codes can also be run from within AMUSE, e.g. using
	      the options -g or -G in test_ph4.py.

	      test_ph4.py	runs parallel_hermite_4
	      test_ph4.py -g	runs parallel_hermite_4 -g
	      test_ph4.py -G	runs parallel_hermite_4_noGPU

	      Not all of the close-enconter options in the standalone
	      codes are currently supported in the AMUSE versions --
	      they will be selected in future implementatons using
	      initialization parameters.

   QUIRKS AND BUGS:

	* the GPU and non-GPU codes produce slightly different
	  numbers, as should be expected, since the detailed
	  arithmetic operations aren't exactly the same

	* the parallel and non-parallel versions should produce the
	  same results -- currently NOT the case: TO BE FIXED

		mpiexec -n NN parallel_hermite_4 ... | egrep '%%%|Emerge'

		parallel_hermite_4 -e 0 ...
		mpiexec -n 1 parallel_hermite_4 -e 0 ...	same
		mpiexec -n 2 parallel_hermite_4 -e 0 ...	different
		
		parallel_hermite_4 -e 0.001 ...
		mpiexec -n 1 parallel_hermite_4 -e 0.001 ...	same
		mpiexec -n 2 parallel_hermite_4 -e 0.001 ...	different

		parallel_hermite_4_noGPU -e 0.001 ...
		mpiexec -n 2 parallel_hermite_4_noGPU -e 0.001 ... different

		noGPU differences seem to be significantly smaller

	* results should not depend on the frequency of energy
	  diagnostics -- NOT the case at present: TO BE FIXED

	* current code contains a lot of connented-out debugging lines
          -- clean up eventually...


2. close_encounter: code to manage close encounters within ph4,
   currently only available in the standalone version of ph4.

   File: close_encounter.cc.


3. smallN: standalone few-body integrator using a shared-timestep,
   time-symmetrized, 4th-order Hermite integrator incorporating
   partial and fully unperturbed binary motion; designed to be used
   with the close_encounter package in ph4, but this has not yet been
   implemented.

   Files: smallN.cc, kepler.[ch]*, hdyn.[ch]*, analyze.cc.
   Usage: makeplummer -n 4 -i -C | smallN <args>


4. kepler: two-body orbit creation and manipulation routines,
   compliant with Starlab-style trees and data structures, but largely
   independent of them; a standalone version also exists.

   Files: kepler.h, kepler.cc, hdyn.[ch]*.
   Usage: kepler <args>


5. analyze: routines to decompose a few-body system into stable
   substructure and determine when an interaction is over; integrated
   with smallN, but could also available as a standalone program.

   Files: analyze.cc, kepler.[ch]*, hdyn.[ch]*.
   Usage: makeplummer -n 4 -i -C | analyze <args>

Codes 3-5 are based on earlier Starlab code and contain standalone
definitions and extensions of the hdyn class and node/dyn/hdyn member
functions.
