/* Data layout for 2d FFTs:

   data set of Nfast x Nslow elements is owned by P procs
   on input, each proc owns a subsection of the elements
   on output, each proc will own a (possibly different) subsection
   my subsection must not overlap with any other proc's subsection,
     i.e. the union of all proc's input (or output) subsections must
     exactly tile the global Nfast x Nslow data set
   when called from C, all subsection indices are 
     C-style from 0 to N-1 where N = Nfast or Nslow
   when called from F77, all subsection indices are 
     F77-style from 1 to N where N = Nfast or Nslow
   a proc can own 0 elements on input or output
     by specifying hi index < lo index
   on both input and output, data is stored contiguously on a processor
     with a fast-varying and slow-varying index
