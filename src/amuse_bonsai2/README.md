### Bonsai2

This is a more optimized version of Bonsai1, however it also contains fewer features.
This version does not contain stopping conditions or individual/dynamic time-steps.

To run the code, make sure to type the following in your console otherwise the code hangs/crashes.

`$ ulimit -s unlimited`
