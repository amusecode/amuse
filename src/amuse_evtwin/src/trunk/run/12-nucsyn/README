This run shows how to run the nucleosynthesis post-processing code.
It evolves a 3 solar mass star from the pre-main sequence onwards.
The initial abundances for the nucleosynthesis code are read from the
namelist ABUND at the very end of init.dat. These are based on Anders &
Grevesse (1989) abundances.

Compared to a standard run the main differences are:
 1. starting from a pre-main sequence model rather than a ZAMS model
 2. the timestep control parameters CDC are set so that the timesteps are
    (very) small. This is desirable for the nucleosynthesis code to
    converge properly.
