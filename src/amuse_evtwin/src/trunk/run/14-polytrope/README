This test job evolves a 1 solar mass star from a fully convective polytrope
with a central temperature of 1e6K (a pre-main sequence model).
The polytropic model is created on-the-fly by the code, and as such the
code doesn't require the ZAMS library in this mode.

Activating the polytropic mode works by initialising with IP1 = 0. The
number of iterations KR1 in init.dat should be large for the code to
converge at all.

The current code has been tested (and found to work) in the range 0.4-100
Msun. Some parameter tweaking may be needed for different masses.
