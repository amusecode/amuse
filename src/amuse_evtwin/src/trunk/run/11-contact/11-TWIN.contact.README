     Evolution into and during contact, using the TWIN mode. The
luminosity transfer during the contact phase is modeled by the
assumption, based on the supposition that there is differential 
rotation as in the Sun, that there is an effective energy-generation
rate of plus or minus `const. (enthalpy(*1) - enthalpy(*2))'. The
const. is just the rate of differential rotation, which I take to
be 10**-8 sec**-1.
