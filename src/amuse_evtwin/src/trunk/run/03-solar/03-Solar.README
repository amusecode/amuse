   Evolves a solar-like model, including magnetic braking and
mass loss. We have to start at 1.0135 Msun to get the present
parameters, more-or-less, at age 4.6Gyr.
   The second run (init.run_2) illustrates how to start from the 
last model of a previous run. The first run did 200 timesteps, 
and the second starts from there and does another 200.
