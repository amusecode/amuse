================================================================================
                              1-D problems
================================================================================

cpaw1d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test of Toth.  This initializes only truly 1D
tests, that is wave must be in x1-direction only.

linear_wave1d.c:
================
Linear Wave convergence test.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D problems, but wave must be
grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis respectively.

shkset1d.c:
===========
Shock Set -- initializes 1D Riemann problems.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D
problems, but shock must be grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis
respectively.

shu-osher.c
===========
Initializes 1D Riemann problem of Shu & Osher.  Only works in 1D (along x1).

twoibw.c:
=========
Two Interacting Blast Waves test of Woodward & Colella.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D
problems, but shock must be grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis
respectively.

================================================================================
                              2-D problems
================================================================================

blast.c:
========
Generates a spherical blast wave in both hydro and MHD.  For MHD, field is
in x-y plane.  Can be used for 2D and 3D (although B must be in x-y plane).

carbuncle.c
===========
Sets up propagating planar shock in 2D/3D to test for carbuncle instability.
Shock is stable only when --enable-h-correction is used.

cpaw2d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test of Toth.  Initializes wavevector at any
arbitrary angle to grid in 2D.

dmr.c:
======
Double Mach Reflection test of Woodward & Colella.  Only works for genuinely
2D problems in x1-x2 plane.

field_loop.c
============
Advection of a passive field-loop in 2D/3D, used to test CT algorithm in GS05.

kh.c
====
Initializes two versions of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability test.

linear_wave2d.c:
================
Linear Wave convergence test.  Can run 2D problems, with wavevector at any
angle in the x1-x2 plane.

lw_implode.c:
=============
Liska & Wendroff implosion problem (Sod shocktube in a box).  Only works
for genuinely 2D problems in x1-x2 plane.

noh.c
=====
Strong shock test of Noh, implemented in 2D as described by Liska & Wendroff.
Consists of convergent radial flow at very high Mach number.

orszag-tang.c:
==============
Orszag & Tang MHD vortex problem.  Only works for genuinely 2D problems
in x1-x2 plane.

pgflow.c
========
"Planar Gravitational flow" test.  Sets up an analytic solution for a
steady flow in a periodic potential.  Code should hold this steady flow.
Good test of gravitational source terms, especially if flow is set at an
angle to grid.

rotor.c
=======
MHD rotor test of Balsara & Spicer, as improved by Toth.

rt.c
====
Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.  Initializes both 2D and 3D problems,
with and without a magnetic field.

shk_cloud.c
===========
Strong shock incident on a spherical cloud, with and without a magnetic field.

shkset2d.c:
===========
Shock Set -- initializes 2D Riemann problems.  Can run 2D problems, with
wavevector at any angle in the x1-x2 plane.

================================================================================
                              3-D problems
================================================================================

blast.c:
========
Generates a spherical blast wave in both hydro and MHD.  For MHD, field is
in x-y plane.  Can be used for 3D, but B must be in x-y plane.

cpaw3d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test of Toth.  Initializes wavevector at any
arbitrary angle to grid in 3D.

field_loop.c

================
Linear Wave convergence test.  Can run 3D problems, with wavevector at any
angle to the grid.

noh.c
=====
Strong shock test of Noh, extended to 3D based on 2D problem described by
Liska & Wendroff.  Consists of convergent radial flow at very high Mach number.

rt.c
====
Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem.  Initializes 3D problems,
with and without a magnetic field.

shk_cloud.c
===========
Strong shock incident on a spherical cloud, with and without a magnetic field.

shkset3d.c:
