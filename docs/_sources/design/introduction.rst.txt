Introduction
=============


In this document we will describe the high level design of AMUSE. During
the development period of AMUSE this document will be a 
"Work in Progress". It will be updated to state latests ideas about
the design and reflect the current implementation. More detailed 
documentation can be found in the reference documentation.

AMUSE
-----
AMUSE combines existing astrophysical numerical codes
into a single system. 

Goal
~~~~

To develop a toolbox for performing numerical astrophysical
experiments.  The toolbox provides:

* A standard way of input and output of astrophysical data.
* Support for set-up and management of numerical experiments.
* A unique method to couple a wide variety of physical codes
* A legacy set of standard, proven codes. These codes will be integrated 
  into AMUSE as modules. Each module can be used stand-alone or in
  combination with other modules
* A standard way for adding new modules to AMUSE.
* Examples to show the use of each module and possible couplings 
  between the modules.
* Documentation containing introduction, howtos and reference documents.


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
AMUSE is originally developed at the Leiden Observatory. The Leiden Observatory is
a faculty of the Leiden University in the Netherlands. Funding is provided
by a NOVA grant.
