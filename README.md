This repository contains the AMUSE software. With AMUSE you can write
scripts to simulate astrophysical problems in different domains.

The project website is:

Getting Started
===============

AMUSE runs on Linux and macOS, and on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

We're working on getting AMUSE into conda-forge, but in the mean time it needs to be
installed from source. See
[the AMUSE installation
instructions](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installing.html) for how to
do that, or if you're reading this locally see the `doc/install/` directory.

After that, have a look at the [AMUSE
tutorial](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html) to get started, or
if you prefer notebooks, give the [interactive
tutorial](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactive_tutorial/index.html) a
try. Those too can be found locally in `doc/`.
